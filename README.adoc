= Guidelines for Developing Restful APIs at Sonae MC

== Purpose

Great RESTful APIs look like they were designed by a single team. This
promotes API adoption, reduces friction, and enables clients to use them
properly. To build APIs that meet this standard, and to answer many
common questions encountered along the way of RESTful API development,
the API Guilt team has created this comprehensive set of guidelines.
We have shared it with you to inspire additional discussion and
refinement within and among your teams, and contribute our learnings, suggestions and
recommendations to the tech community at large.

== Usage

As a Sonae MC API's Craftman, you MUST use these guidelines as a guidance whenever you create or change an API. As such, you should consider this to be a living and evolving document. We will revise and update based on our learnings and experiences.
